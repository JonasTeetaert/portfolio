			Welcome! My name is Jonas, Iâ€™m 22 years old and just graduated as a bachelor Multimedia &amp; Communication technology at the Erasmushogeschool Brussels. I am fully educated in web production, UX-design, application building and film production.<br>
			<br>
			I had the opportunity to work abroad to complete my internship of 3 months at GANDA, located in the center of Amsterdam, as a front-end developer intern. I enjoyed these three learn-full months that much that I decided to continue to grow in this direction.<br>
			<br>
			I have a good knowledge about HTML5, CSS3, PHP and javascript, where I learned to work in an object-oriented way. Terms like Gulp, SASS, LESS and Git are a must in my projects and I work with the Mobile First principle on responsive websites to fit all screen sizes.<br>
			<br>
			As my studies payed attention to all the components of the multimedia sector, I can handle most of the Adobe programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and I have developed applications in Java. I also did acquire basic knowledge about SQL, Drupal and Wordpress.<br>
			<br>
			I believe in a healthy working environment where there are good relationships with colleagues and clients and where one strives for optimal customer satisfaction. Are you looking for an front-end developer and do you have an interest to get to see more of me, do not hesitate to contact me.<br>
