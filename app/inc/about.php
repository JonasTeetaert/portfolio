			Welcome visitor, my name is Jonas, Iâ€™m 22 years old and just graduated as a bachelor Multimedia &amp; Communicationtechnology at the Erasmushogeschool Brussels. There I gained a range of knowledge concerning web production, UX-design, application building and film production.<br>
			<br>
			In function of my education, I did an internship of 3 months at GANDA, located in the center of Amsterdam, as a front-end developer intern. This pleased me so well that I want to continue to grow in this function.<br>
			<br>
			I have a good knowledge about HTML5, CSS3, PHP and javascript, where i work in an object-oriented way. Terms like Gulp, SASS, LESS and Git are a must in my projects and I work with the Mobile First principle on responsive websites for all screen sizes.<br>
			<br>

			Because my study payed attention to all the components of the multimedia sector, I can handle the Adobe programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects and have I developed applications in Java. I know the required basic knowledge about SQL, Drupal and Wordpress.<br>
			<br>
			I believe in a healthy working environment where there are good relationships with colleagues and clients and where one strives for
			optimal customer satisfaction. Are you looking for an front-end developer and do you have an interest, do not hesitate to contact me.<br>
